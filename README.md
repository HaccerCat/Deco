# Deco
Deco is a bot that I made, written in nodejs, since I'm no longer working on this bot, I have chose to make it open source project

### commands
- help
- eval

- send
- invite
- stats
### How to run
- run ```npm install``` to install the required modules
- add your bot token in index.js
- add your files that you want the bot to be sending in ```assets/sc3d/your_files_here```
- run index.js
### Credits
